# Step-by-Step Guide to Running the Employee Attrition/Layoff Prediction Code

This guide provides instructions on how to set up your environment and run the generated Python code for the employee attrition/layoff prediction system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Python:** Version 3.6 or higher is recommended. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **pip:** The Python package installer. It is usually included with Python installations.

## Installing Necessary Packages

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn imblearn xgboost
```

This command will install pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning tools, imblearn for handling imbalanced datasets, and xgboost for the XGBoost model.

## Saving the Python Code

The Python code for the prediction system needs to be saved to a file. Copy the generated Python code and paste it into a new text file. Save this file as `prediction_script.py` in a directory of your choice.

## Running the Python Script

Navigate to the directory where you saved `prediction_script.py` using your terminal or command prompt. Then, run the script using the following command:

```bash
python prediction_script.py
```

## Expected Output

Upon running the script, you should see the following output printed to your terminal:

*   **Classification Report:** This will show metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and support for both the '0' (no attrition/layoff) and '1' (attrition/layoff) classes.
*   **Confusion Matrix:** A table summarizing the performance of the classification model, showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
*   **ROC-AUC Score:** This metric evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between the two classes. A score of 1.0 represents a perfect model, while 0.5 represents a model no better than random guessing.

The specific values in the output will depend on the synthetic data generated and the model's performance.
